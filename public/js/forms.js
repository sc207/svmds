     HOW THIS SEVA IS FUNDED
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     Three answers, not a checkbox. It used to be one tick — "Bapa is
     covering part of this" — with an amount underneath, and the trust
     then asked for a fourth thing the tick could not say: a seva given
     outright by Bhuvaji Suresh Bapa. Typing the full contribution into
     the "part" box would have stored the same numbers, but it is not
     the same statement: a gift means nothing is ever asked of the
     sevarthi, and the form has to stop offering to take it.

     Three mutually exclusive options is exactly what a radio group is
     for, and at three the guidance is to show them all rather than
     hide them in a select — the choice is the point of this step.

       sevarthi  the sevarthi gives the whole contribution
       part      Bapa covers a share of it, the sevarthi the rest
       gift      Bapa gives the whole seva

     The two fields the server actually reads — bhuvaji_enabled and
     bhuvaji_planned_amount — are kept exactly as they were, so every
     existing caller and every existing check still works; `is_gift`
     rides alongside. A gift sets the share from the contribution
     rather than asking for it twice.

     This flow was four steps and asked the same eight devotee fields

     is three steps now, each devotee field asked exactly once, and the

     What holds the three together is the rule the rest of the app's

     asks only that step's questions, and the footer carries the one
     action that moves you forward. The previous version put "Continue"
